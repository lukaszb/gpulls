gpulls
======

Shows pull requests assigned to you. Github Pull Requests page lists not merged
PRs and their *creators*, not currently assigned users. I have created this
simple executable script so it can be dropped into your ``PATH`` and run with::

    $ pulls

In order this script could be run one must have ``~/.github-key`` file that
contains API key from Github. Grab one from
https://github.com/settings/tokens/new, copy it and paste to ``~/.github-key``.
